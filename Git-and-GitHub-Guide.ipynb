    "## Git\n",
    "\n",
    "Git is a distributed version control system (VCS) designed to track changes in source code during software development. It allows multiple developers to collaborate on projects by managing and recording changes to files over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "Git helps developers keep track of changes made to their codebase. It works by creating a repository (repo) where all project files are stored along with a history of changes. Developers can make changes locally, create checkpoints (commits) of their work, and then push those commits to a central repository or share them with others. Git enables branching, merging, and reverting to previous versions, providing a structured way to manage code evolution and collaboration.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## GitHub\n",
    "\n",
    "GitHub is a web-based platform built on top of Git, providing additional features for collaboration and project management. It hosts Git repositories and offers tools for code review, issue tracking, project management, and team collaboration.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "GitHub extends the functionality of Git by providing a centralized platform for hosting Git repositories in the cloud. It allows developers to store their code repositories online, making it accessible from anywhere. GitHub facilitates collaboration through features like pull requests (for proposing changes), issues (for tracking bugs or tasks), and project boards (for organizing tasks). It also serves as a social network for developers, enabling them to showcase their work, contribute to open-source projects, and build a professional network.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points\n",
    "- **Git** is a version control system for tracking changes in code.\n",
    "- **GitHub** is a platform that hosts Git repositories and adds collaboration features.\n",
    "- Together, Git and GitHub form a powerful combination for version control, code sharing, and collaborative software development.\n",
